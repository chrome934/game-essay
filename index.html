<h2 style=font-size:30px";><p>Games and sports are an essential part of education in an individual’s life. The main target of studies is the mental, physical and moral development of a student. A sound body will contain a sound mind. The mind can never be strong if the body is weak.
</p>
<p>Students can build their health and body by playing games and sports which provide exercise in the fresh and open air. Games help an individual learn discipline and sportsmanship. Games offer a good drill for playing the game of life. A true player is uncaring of joy and sorrows. Individuals learn to laugh in the face of failures if he plays games. In the art of living, games provide the best education. In the formation of a good character, the spirit of sportsmanship provides individuals assistance.

</p>
<p>Games and sports can bring excitement in the dull life of students. If someone is the captain of any sports team, he can wind the heart of his team through respect, love, sympathy and fair play. The best use of leisure can be made by playing games. The surplus energy of young people can also be released while playing games because if the surplus energy doesn’t come out, it may result in indiscipline and mischief. Students and the younger generation should keep themselves busy while they are not studying because the idle brain is the devil’s workshop and games are the best way to pass their times.
